React Project Setup and Run Instructions

Requirements
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Setup
Download or clone the repository where the App.js file is located.

Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the App.js file is located.

Run npm install command to install the project dependencies.

Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, run npm start command to start the development server.

The project will open in a new browser window at http://localhost:3000/.

Click on the Fetch Metadata button to fetch the input fields metadata from the API.

Fill out the form and click on the Predict Drink Choice button to make a prediction.

Check the browser console to see the API response and prediction results.

Click on the Batch Prediction button to make batch predictions.

Check the browser console to see the API response and prediction results.
Note

Make sure to replace the API_URL, MODEL_ID and ACCESS_TOKEN with your own values if you want to use this code with your own API.


What does this code do? 
This code is a React component that renders a simple form to allow users to input their personal information such as name, age, gender, occupation, and drink preference. It then uses the fetchPrediction function to send the user's input to an API endpoint that runs a machine learning model to predict their preferred drink. The prediction result is then displayed on the page.

The code also includes fetchMetadata function to fetch metadata information about the model from the API endpoint, and fetchBatchPrediction function to send multiple user inputs to the API endpoint for batch prediction.

The API endpoint URL, model ID, and access token are stored in variables for security purposes. The useState hook is used to manage the state of the form inputs and the prediction result.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to integrate a machine learning model into a React application and use it to make predictions based on user inputs.

The functions I added: 

1. added the batch functionality of the TOM API
2. Security feature: One security feature that i addED to the code is to sanitize the input data received from the user to prevent potential security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
